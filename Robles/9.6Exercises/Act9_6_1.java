      //Class - A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
        //For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake

      //Object - An object is called an instance of a class. For example, suppose Bicycle is a class then MountainBicycle,
        //SportsBicycle, TouringBicycle, etc can be considered as objects of the class.

      //Instantiate -Instantiate in Java means to call a constructor of a Class which creates an an instance or object, of the type of that Class.
        // Instantiation allocates the initial memory for the object and returns a reference.

      //Instance Variables- An instance variable is a variable which is declared in a class but outside of constructors, methods, or blocks.

      //Instance Method - An instance method in Java is basically a method of the class.
        // In other words, a non-static method which is declared inside a class is an instance method.

      //Class Variables - a class variable is any variable declared with the static modifier of which a single copy exists,
        // regardless of how many instances of the class exist

      //Constructors - A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
        // The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
